Question 2

	Here is the following test:
	
	[5]
	[3, 5]
	[7, 3, 5]
	
	7
	5
	2
	3
	7
	
	[6]
	6
	[8, 6]
	false
	6
	[8, 6]

	
	The running time of int size() method is O(1) because it is constant time that returns the variable count.

	
	The running time of boolean isEmpty() method is O(1) because it is constant time that checks if count == 0.
	
	
	The running time of E first() method is O(1) because it is constant time because that returns the first element of the tail.
	
	
	The running time of E last() method is O(1) because it a constant that returns the first element of the head.
	
	
	The running time of void addFirst(E element) method is O(n) because the stack operations is linear.
	

	The running time of void addLast(E element) method is O(n) because the stack operations is linear.
	
	
	The running time of E removeFirst() method is O(n) because the stack operations is linear.
	
	
	The running time of void E removeLast() method is O(n) because the stack operations is linear.
